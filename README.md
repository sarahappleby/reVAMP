# reVAMP
Voigt Automatic Multinest Profiles

reVAMP is the new version of VAMP:
https://github.com/sarahappleby/VAMP/
and continues where 'vamp_2.0' left off.

reVAMP fits absorption spectral features with Voigt and Gaussian profiles and finds the optimal number of profiles to fit.

TODO:
- Determine the Multinest parameters that will fit features correctly every time.
- Optimize this for speed.
- Fix setup.sh script such that it works from the command line.
- Put together notebooks with examples.
- Output plot with the fit components.
